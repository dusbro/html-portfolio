      <p>Just an absolute classic of a comedy. Jeff Bridges is 100% now and forever the dude!</p>

    <h3>Se7en (Seven)</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/se7en_img.jpg" height="150" alt="bradd pitt and morgan freeman" />
      <p>One of my all time favorite thrillers. The first time I watched this I was on the edge of my seat. Could not believe what was in the box in the end.</p>

    <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/totoro_umbrella.gif" height="175" alt="totoro with umbrella" />
      <p>This was the very first anime I had ever watched when I took Japanese in 6th Grade. Studio Ghibli has never failed to deliver masterpieces.</p>
